# tempus-college
A website that allows the user to see the current availability of his peers according to their university time-table and free hours.

it's cringe but it's a start

Setup --

1. A simple always-on clock onto  a website, kind of like timeanddate.com

2. Preparing the Database:

a) Using SQL, create timetables of 3 individuals with attributes such as:
  1. Name 
  2. Status (Busy/Free)
  3. Project (What he or she is working on or which class they're attending)
  4. Timing

4. Make the site pull data to interface with the database. 
  Interface using  SQLConnector for JS or C++ depending on how my mood is.

$ A status bar; big bold text that interfaces with 2-point displays.

IF no work, alpha version ~ 2days
