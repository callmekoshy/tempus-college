# tempus-college
A website that allows the user to see the current availability of his peers according to their university time-table and free hours.
How would I go about executing this program? This is for the sake of my thought process.

First, code a simple always-on clock onto  a website, kind of like timeanddate.com
Have the website up and running asap.
Preparing the Database:
Using SQL creating timetables of 3 individuals with attributes such as:
1. Name 
2. Status (Busy/Free)
3. Project (What he or she is working on or which class they're attending)
4. Timing

Make the site pull data to interface with the database by connecting it using the SQLConnector command for JS or C++ depending on which language the website is coded in.

have  a status link that has big bold text that interfaces with point 2 and displays BUSY or FREE in big bold letters. color could be green for free and red for busy.

also have a sidebar that interfaces with point 3 and 4 to show the work and how long it's gonna be for. 

with this i expect the alpha version of the site to be operational within 6 days.
